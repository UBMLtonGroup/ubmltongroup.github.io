Welcome to [UB's](http://www.buffalo.edu/) MLton Group. 

We are actively working on bringing MLton, and SML, to embedded real-time systems. 
We believe there's a great potential for functional programming to make a significant 
impact on the time it takes to produce embedded code, as well as the fidelity of that 
code. 

Please check out our publications and Github repos for details on our work.
