> There is a growing interest in leveraging functional programming languages in real-time and embedded contexts. Functional languages are appealing as many are strictly typed, amenable to formal methods, have limited mutation, and have simple, but powerful concurrency control mechanisms. Although there have been many recent proposals for specialized domain specific languages for embedded and real-time systems, there has been relatively little progress on adapting more general purpose functional languages for programming embedded and real-time systems. In this paper we present our current work on leveraging Standard ML in the embedded and real-time domains. Specifically we detail our experiences in modifying MLton, a whole program, optimizing compiler for Standard ML, for use in such contexts. We focus primarily on the language runtime, re-working the threading subsystem and garbage collector. We provide preliminary results over a radar-based aircraft collision detector ported to SML.

>Functional programming languages play an important role in the development of correct software systems. As embedded devices become pervasive and perform critical tasks in our lives, their reliability becomes paramount. This presents a natural opportunity to explore the application of functional programming languages to systems that demand highly predictable behavior. In this paper, we explore existing functional programming language compilers and their applicability to real‐time embedded systems. We do this by defining important characteristics needed by a real‐time programming language and survey how well existing languages meet these characteristics. We conduct empirical analysis of language runtimes in order to assess the impact of dynamic memory management on predictability and performance. Lastly, we review different programming models for expressing real‐time considerations in applications.
