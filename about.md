Welcome to UBMLton Group.

We are a research group at the [University at Buffalo's](http://www.buffalo.edu/) [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu) department. Our specific area of research is applying functional programming languages to real-time embedded systems. In particular, we are experimenting with enhancing the [MLton](http://www.mlton.org) compiler to optimize application code for embedded targets.
